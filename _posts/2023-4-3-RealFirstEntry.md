__Intro__: This is actually the real first entry for this blog. I didn't realize I had this entry on my other blog and decided to migrated it over.

### Testing

__Body__:

Testing and research--research and testing. More of the same.

Burnout isn't even on the horizon for me--it's my everyday existence. It sucks.

Anyway... here are some images of the radio setup:

Planning on doing some aprs testing with the handheld. I'm still learning and have much to learn, but I'm enjoying it thus far.

I can't seem to commit to making entries. It's weird because I have so many ideas and projects that I want to work on, but I just can't bring myself to give a crap at the moment.
