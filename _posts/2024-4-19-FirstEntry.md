__Intro__: Spun up another blog for radio and wireless related projects. I got this domain, Operators.Win, to build a blog around my journey into HAM radio. I was also thinking that I could offer subdomains to other operators that might want to start up their own blogs as well.

### New Blog

__Body__:

Going to simplify this one. I don't think the format needs to be extravagant.

This is the first entry and there isn't much else to be said.
